# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game is designed for two players, where Player X and Player O take turns marking the cells in a 3x3 grid. The game announces a winner when one player manages to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or declares a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.

## Features

- Two-player game: Player X and Player O.
- Interactive game board with visual feedback for each turn.
- Winning condition detection (row, column, or diagonal).
- Displays a message when a player wins or the game results in a draw.
- Buttons to **Reset** the game or start a **New Game**.
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game grid and controls.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game board, buttons, and winner/draw messages.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including checking for a winner, updating the game board, and handling user interactions.
